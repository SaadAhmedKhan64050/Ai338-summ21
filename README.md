## Project Description:
 By using multinomial naive bayes classification we trained our first ML-model on Python. In Naive Bayes classifier is a general term which refers to conditional independence of each of the features in the model, while Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is a specific instance of a Naive Bayes classifier which uses a multinomial distribution for each of the features. We downloaded train.csv and test.csv file from the Kaggle Titanic competition data. The model was trained by using the built-in function 'prediction' to predict. In the result, after the updation of files the data will split the only data that will left is of the one that survived, including passenger ids.
