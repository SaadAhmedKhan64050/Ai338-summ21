## Project Description:
 By using multinomial naive bayes classification. We trained our first ML-model in Python. Naive Bayes classifier is a general term which refers to conditional independence of each of the features in the model, while Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is a specific instance of a Naive Bayes classifier which uses a multinomial distribution for each of the features. We downloaded train.csv and test.csv file from the Kaggle Titanic competition data. The model was trained by using the built-in function 'prediction' to predict. In the result, after the updating files the data will split. The only data that left without using any validation techniques is of those who survived, including passenger ids.
